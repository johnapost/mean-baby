What is Mean Baby?
==================

Mean Baby is my first full foray into the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS).

Getting Started
===============

    npm install
    gulp

Tests
=====

No tests currently planned. This is meant as a learning project for myself to practice building a NodeJS API and serving it to an AngularJS app. Unit tests would be handled in AngularJS and feature tests would be handled in Protractor.

Contributing
============

Feel free to fork. I don't expect to maintain this project.
